# todolistMDP

This code is going to serve as backend to a to-do list web application that computes an optimal order of tasks to be completed.

Starting from the original [code by Andrew Tan](https://github.com/andrewztan/todolistMDP), we have made the following changes:
- Re-written in Python 3
- Re-factored in accordance with PEP 8 standards
- Removed duplicate functions
- Removed unnecessary files
- Simplified tests

#### Implemented algorithms by Andrew Tan
- Backward induction
- Policy iteration
- Value iteration

The documentation of the code will be written as the code is being developed.
