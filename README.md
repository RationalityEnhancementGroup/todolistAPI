This is the server for our future Complice experiments with Workflowy task lists.

# Possible Routes (WIP)

None of these have been implemented yet, but we are hoping to create  the following routes (parameters TBD):

* `/static`
* `/random`
* `/hierarchical`
* `/length`
* `/length-deadline`
* `/old-report`

# Required Python Packages

* cherrypy
